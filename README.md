I've been a huge Guitar Hero fan since the very first release on PS2. When the idea of demakes came up, I decided it would be a nice opportunity to try recreating one of my favorite franchises. 

This was my first adventure through defining and using my own classes in Unity. Each gem and chord have a number of attributes including their color, placement in the song, status as a hammer on or pulloff, and others. That stuff came out pretty well. 

Unfortunately, the rest of the code is just a mess, haha. Lots of poor code techniques just for the effort of time and my own rusty-ness. Also, as it turns out, trying to time gem generation consistently for an entire song is pretty tough. 

I wasn't able to implement all of the features I wanted including Star Power, pass/fail meter, and detecting erroneous strums. There's also only one pretty short song, sadly. All and all, it's a pretty light take on Guitar Hero that I'm proud of in some ways and kind of embarrassed of in others.
